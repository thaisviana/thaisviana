### Thais Viana ðŸ‘‹

I dedicate my life to combining my two passions: teaching and creative coding. At the moment, I am teaching Python and JS to computer engineering classes at Infnet Institute. And I am a partner at grama creative coding studio.

I lead the most diverse projects such as art installations, data visualization, complex dashboards, mobile apps, and web development in general in my role as partner and project manager at grama.

For five years as a backend developer, I worked on more than 30 projects using Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Celery, and Flask to solve the most varied data manipulation problems giving me extensive expertise in high complexity projects.

I acquired Natural Language Processing knowledge during my master's in Artificial Intelligence at UFRJ. That knowledge came in handy when I built and delivered data visualization projects for several companies like Google, Casa Firjan, and Museu do AmanhÃ£ as a backend developer. 

I also had the pleasure of developing projects used by hundreds of thousands of people in a single day. I'm someone who matches my rÃ©sumÃ©. I study hard my subjects of interest, and I always build a creative format to put new projects into practice.

If you're interested in talking to me, I'm available for a coffee.
